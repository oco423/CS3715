After meeting and learning about node js in general, we put Group E's assignment 3 website on excalibur. 
In order to get our comments on the server without local storage, we decided to save all of the user input
from all fields into various JSON files. Through research, we discovered the module express module formidable
and its ability to parse form elements individually. We realized an express project was essential for this project.
Through mostly trial and error, we were able to use Javascript to load JSON data into our webpages similarly to our
3rd assignment. We then learned more about formidable and developed a simple application to write to JSON files from
forms on a page. We eventually combined our file writing and file reading and implemented it to our website. 


**Extra Functionalities**

After the presentation,

 
1. we implemented a functional booking option on our desktop and mobile webpages.
2. we revamped our CSS files (both desktop and mobile). 

******* In Addition*********

For deleting a comment you have to type in the title of the comment you wish to delete.
Deleted comments and responses are completely removed from our webpage.

If you try to run our webpage as your own express project make sure you install all modules listed in package.JSON.


Thank you very much.
