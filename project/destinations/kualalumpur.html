<div class="tour"> <li><h2>Tour A: Petronas Towers </h2></li>

<a target="_blank" href="../images/petronas-twin-tower.jpg" title="Petronas Twin Towers">
<img src="../images/petronas-twin-tower.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="Petronas Twin Towers"></a>

<p> The Petronas Twin Towers is an iconic landmark that merits a visit (and photo opportunity) for any
first-time visitor to Kuala Lumpur. Built in 1998, the sleek structure stands at 88 storeys high and
joined by a double-decker Sky Bridge that offers an exhilarating view of KL city centre and beyond.
Set at the foot of Petronas Twin Towers is Suria KLCC Shopping Mall, which hosts an array of international
brands, cinema, two food courts, an art gallery, restaurants, concert hall, and the massive Aquaria KLCC.
Just a short walk away is KLCC Park, an expansive manmade park with a jogging track, walking paths, water
fountains, and a wading pool for children. Do note that you will need a pass to enter the Sky Bridge and
since a limited number are issued each day, it is highly advisable to get there early in the morning. </p> </div>

<div class="tour"> <li><h2>Tour B: Batu Caves </h2></li>

<a target="_blank" href="../images/batu-caves.jpg" title="Batu Caves">
<img src="../images/batu-caves.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="Batu Caves"></a>

<p> Located approximately 11 kilometres to the north of Kuala Lumpur, Batu Caves is a limestone hill
comprising three major caves and a number of smaller ones. Standing just outside the cave is a 140ft
statue of Lord Murugan, which is comprised of 250 tons of steel bars, 1,550 cubic meters of concrete,
and 300 liters of gold paint. Considered one of Kuala Lumpur's most frequented tourist attractions,
this 100-year-old temple features idols and statues erected inside the main caves and around it.
Incorporated with interior limestone formations said to be around 400 million years old, the
temple is considered an important religious landmark by Hindus. </p>

<p> Cathedral Cave - the largest and most popular cavern in Batu Caves - houses several Hindu shrines beneath
its 100-metre-high arched ceiling. At the foot of Batu Hill are two other cave temples - the Art Gallery
Cave and Museum Cave - which houses numerous Hindu statues and paintings. </p> </div></ul>

<p> Well organized so it's not over crowded however it also limits your time on each level. You purchase
a ticket for<br> specified viewing times. Worth doing if you like going up tall buildings.</p></div>

Towers..... very central.... the mall below is worth a visit to...... and if you can get up to the 2 view
points.... Good Venue to go to for lunch and views while it's warm outside...... </p></div>

<p> Batu Caves and the statue (With due respect to its religious aspect) in front of the cave is a worthy
place to visit for every one. I had counted the steps with my wife but forgotten now. A very big statue
in front of the hilly cave.</p></div>

<p> limestone caves, with Hindu temples inside, mind blowing experience, there are 272 steps to get to the
top so take water and appropriate footwear, there are temple monkey's that run around and will take any
food but not water!. Appropriate clothing to be worn. :-) </p></div>
